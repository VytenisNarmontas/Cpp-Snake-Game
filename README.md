# Cpp-Snake-Game
C++ Console snake game with different maps imported from .txt files.

Firstly you need to download the two maps. M1 and M2.
When you launch the c++ file you will be prompted with a question in console. 
You need to input the name of the map you want to play in as given in the example [M1] or [M2].
M1 is a simple 10x10 map
M2 is a more complicated map with walls in the middle.

Movement using WASD keys.

Have fun :D
